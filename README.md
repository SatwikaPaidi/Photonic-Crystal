### Photonic Crystals

**Project Name:** Photonic Crystals

**Description:**
This project focuses on the characterization of photonic crystals, optical materials with a periodic structure that manipulates light in unique ways. The study includes the preparation and analysis of photonic crystals using techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and UV-Vis spectrometry to explore their structural and optical properties.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Material Preparation:** Developed photonic crystals using polystyrene nanospheres and characterized their periodic structure.
- **XRD Analysis:** Identified the crystal structure and calculated Miller indices, revealing the amorphous nature with consistent BCC indices.
- **SEM Imaging & UV-Vis Spectrometry:** Analyzed surface morphology and optical properties, confirming the transparency and light absorption behavior of the samples.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Gained expertise in material characterization techniques and their application to optical materials.
- Enhanced understanding of the structural and optical behavior of photonic crystals, with a focus on their potential applications in various fields.
